# NTAPI Injection Technique

## Overview
This project demonstrates the NTAPI Injection technique, a low-level method for injecting code into remote processes using Native API functions like `NtAllocateVirtualMemory` and `NtCreateThreadEx`.

NTAPI Injection is a stealthier alternative to traditional methods like Shellcode or DLL Injection, often used for advanced malware or evasion techniques.

## Features
- Leverages Native API for stealthy process injection.
- Bypasses high-level API hooks monitored by security solutions.
- Direct interaction with the Windows Kernel.
